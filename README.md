# Coppock

Coppock is an indicator for MT4, MT5, and cTrader by EarnForex.com. It is an implementation of the classic curve indicator by Edward Coppock who developed the formula it back in 1962.

It is plotted in a separate window of the chart using a histogram. Arrow signals are displayed in the main chart window.

You can modify the indicator's period and style parameters and also turn on alerts.

It can be used to find trend extrema - basically, it is an oscillator without fixed upper and lower levels.
